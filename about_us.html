			<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
			<p>Hello. We're ADAM & AOKI, a technology company dedicated to developing next generation smart clothing. We go beyond being a brand. We're a movement revolutionising the interactions between people and everyday wear.
				&emsp;Our innovative clothing range warns users that they are in risk of getting sunburnt. Using specially developed smart fabric, our products detect dangerous UV rays and warn you via a clear colour change. The warning system also takes into account both your skin type and the time it takes you to burn, and doesn't require phones, apps or electronics.</p>
			<h2>Mission</h2>
			<p>ADAM & AOKI is on a mission to make clothes smarter. For thousands of years we've focused on practically in clothing and that time has come to an end. It's time to start wearing clothes that not only look and feel great, but also help us to overcome everyday challenges like sunburn.</p>
			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<p>We believe that as a business, our aim should be to try to make the world a better place. That's why our vision is to produce sustainable smart clothing on a global scale that is specially designed to help solve millions of real-world problems, each and every day.</p>
			<h2>What makes us ADAM & AOKI</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>#changeit. If you're unhappy or upset with something, be the agent of change.</li>
				<li>Transparency. No good ever came of lies and secrecy. Just ask Romeo & Juliet.</li>
				<li>Doing good. Solving real world problems is what gets us out of bed in the morning and we'd like to keep it that way.</li>
				<li>Persevere. Let's agree to never give up on our individual and shared challenges.</li>
				<li>Sustainability. We ? planet earth, but for it to keep being planet earth we need to take care of it.</li>
				<li>Focus on priorities and prioritise focus. All the unimportant stuff can wait.</li>
				<li>Being busy is a mindset. You're never too busy to do something. You just didn't make time for it and that's fine with us.</li>
				<li>Be forever flexibile. If a 90 year old can do the splits what's your excuse?</li>
				<li>Have Fun. Nothing—and we really mean nothing—should be boring. Including socks.</li>
				<li>Stay Curious. They say curiosity killed the cat but we promise it won't kill you. Quite the opposite in fact.</li>
				<li>Sharing. We think you're amazing and we genuinely mean it. Only thing we ask is that you share your amazingness with everyone around you.</li>
